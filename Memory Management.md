In Java, `all local variables are created on the stack`,  
and they are automatically popped-off from the stack when we reach the closing bracket of the block that created the variable.  
so the stack is used for local primitive variables such as ints and doubles,  
and all the objects such as Integers, Strings or Customers object will be stored in Heap.
